Calculator
==========

It is a simple RPN Calculator. It calculates expressions with proper operation priority handling.
It currently supports +,-,/,*,(,) operations and is open for modification with plugins.



It has its limitations though:
  - cannot handle numbers highter than 9
  - cannot handle operation omission (i.e  2 + 2 (8-1))
